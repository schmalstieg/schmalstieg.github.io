A mobile flying projector is hard to build dueto the limited size and payload capability of a micro aerial vehicle. Few flying projector designs have been studied inrecent research. However, to date, no practical solution has been presented. We propose a versatile laser projection system enabling in-flight projection with feed forward correction for stabilization of projected images. We present a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the projection stabilization intwo autonomous flight experiments. While this approach isour first step towards a flying projector, we foresee interesting applications, such as providing on-site instructions in various human machine interaction scenarios.
