A video tutorial effectively conveys complex motions, butmay be hard to follow precisely because of its restriction toa predetermined viewpoint. Augmented reality (AR) tutori-als have been demonstrated to be more effective. We bringthe advantages of both together by interactively retargetingconventional, two-dimensional videos into three-dimensionalAR tutorials. Unlike previous work, we do not simply overlayvideo, but synthesize 3D-registered motion from the video.Since the information in the resulting AR tutorial is registeredto 3D objects, the user can freely change the viewpoint with-out degrading the experience. This approach applies to manystyles of video tutorials. In this work, we concentrate on aclass of tutorials which alter the surface of an object.
