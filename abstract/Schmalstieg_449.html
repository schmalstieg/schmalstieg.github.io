We introduce the SpatialMouse, a hybrid pointing device that combines the capabilities of a desktop mouse with the spatial input of a virtual reality (VR) controller, enabling seamless transitions between 2D and 3D interaction spaces in immersive mixed reality environments. Holistic usage scenarios in mixed reality involve tasks suited alternately to 2D or 3D information spaces. Yet, existing input devices excel in either 2D or 3D, but not both, making it necessary to switch between multiple input devices (e.g., mouse and VR controller). Our SpatialMouse addresses this issue, offering the affordances of a desktop mouse for indirect 2D pointing and the spatial capabilities of VR controllers with six degrees of freedom. In a user study with 12 participants, our prototype significantly reduced perceived task load and improved user experience compared to switching between separate devices. We extract design recommendations to further support such hybrid input approaches.
