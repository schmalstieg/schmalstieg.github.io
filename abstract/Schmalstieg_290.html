We present an efficient approach for probeless light estimation andcoherent rendering of Augmented Reality in dynamic scenes. Thisapproach can handle dynamically changing scene geometry and dy-namically changing light sources in real time with a single mobileRGB-D sensor and without relying on an invasive lightprobe. Wejointly filter both in-view dynamic geometry and outside-view staticgeometry. The resulting reconstruction provides the input for effi-cient global illumination computation in image-space. We demon-strate that our approach can deliver state-of-the-art Augmented Re-ality rendering effects for scenes that are more scalable and moredynamic than previous work.
