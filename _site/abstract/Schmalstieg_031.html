The area covered by a three-dimensional bounding box after projection onto the screen is relevant for view-dependent algorithms in real-time and photorealistic rendering. We describe a fast method to compute the accurate two-dimensional area of a three-dimensional oriented bounding box, and show how it can be computed equally fast or faster than its approximation with a two-dimensional bounding box enclosing the projected three-dimensional bounding box.
