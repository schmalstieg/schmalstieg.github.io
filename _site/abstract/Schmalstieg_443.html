Extended Reality (XR) is increasingly used as a productivity tool and recent commercial XR devices have even been specifically designed as productivity tools, or, at least, are heavily advertised for such purposes, such as the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), which has now been available for more than one year. In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.
