Efficient rendering of multiple views can be a critical
performance factor for real-time rendering applications.
Generating more than one view multiplies the amount of
rendered geometry, which can cause a huge performance
impact. Minimizing that impact has been a target of previous
research and GPU manufacturers, who have started to equip
devices with dedicated acceleration units. However,
vendor-specific acceleration is not the only option to
increase multi-view rendering (MVR) performance. Available
graphics API features, shader stages and optimizations can
be exploited for improved MVR performance, while generally
offering more versatile pipeline configurations, including
the preservation of custom tessellation and geometry
shaders. In this paper, we present an exhaustive evaluation
of MVR pipelines available on modern GPUs. We provide a
detailed analysis of previous techniques,
hardware-accelerated MVR and propose a novel method, leading
to the creation of an MVR catalogue. Our analyses cover
three distinct applications to help gain clarity on overall
MVR performance characteristics. Our interpretation of the
observed results provides a guideline for selecting the most
appropriate one for various use cases on different GPU
architectures.
