The rise of IoT-ready devices is supported through well-established web concepts for communication and analytics, but interaction yet remains in the world of web browsers and screen-based 2D interaction during times of tablet and smartphone popularity. Transforming IoT interaction concepts into 3D for future exploitation with head-worn XR devices is a difficult task due to the lack of support and continued disengagement of game engines used in XR development. In this work, we present an approach to overcome this limitation, tightly including web technology into a 3D game engine. Our work leverages the versatility of web concepts to create immersive and scalable web applications in XR, without the need for deep-tech know-how about XR concepts or tiring customization work. We describe the methodology and tools in detail and provide some exemplary XR applications.
