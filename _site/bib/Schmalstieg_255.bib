 abstract={In Augmented Reality (AR), ghosted views allow a viewer to explore hidden structure within the real-world environment. A body of previous work has explored which features are suitable to support the structural interplay between occluding and occluded elements. However, the dynamics of AR environments pose serious challenges to the presentation of ghosted views. While a model of the real world may help determine distinctive structural features, changes in appearance or illumination detriment the composition of occluding and occluded structure. In this paper, we present an approach that considers the information value of the scene before and after generating the ghosted view. Hereby, a contrast adjustment of preserved occluding features is calculated, which adaptively varies their visual saliency within the ghosted view visualization. This allows us to not only preserve important features, but to also support their prominence after revealing occluded structure, thus achieving a positive effect on the perception of ghosted views.},
