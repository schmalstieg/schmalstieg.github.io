	abstract={In contrast to indoor tracking using computer vision, which has reached a good amount of maturity, outdoor tracking still suffers from comparably poor localization on a global scale. Smartphones and other commodity devices contain consumer-grade sensors for GPS, compass and inertial measurements, which are not accurate enough for augmented reality (AR) in most situations. This restricts what AR can offer to application areas such as surveying or building constructions. We present a self-contained localization device which connects wirelessly to any AR device, such as a smartphone or headset. The device gives centimeter-level accuracy and can be built out of commercial-of-the-shelf components for less than 500 EUR. We demonstrate the performance of the localization device using a variety of position and orientation sensing benchmarks.},
