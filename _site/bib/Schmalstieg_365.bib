	abstract={In this paper, we introduce the CPatch, a curved primitive that can be used to construct arbitrary vector graphics. A CPatch is a generalization of a 2D polygon: Any number of curves up to a cubic degree bound a primitive. We show that a CPatch can be rasterized efficiently in a hierarchical manner on the GPU, locally discarding irrelevant portions of the curves. Our rasterizer is fast and scalable, works on all patches in parallel, and does not require any approximations. We show a parallel implementation of our rasterizer, which naturally supports all kinds of color spaces, blending and super-sampling. Additionally, we show how vector graphics input can efficiently be converted to a CPatch representation, solving challenges like patch self intersections and false inside-outside classification. Results indicate that our approach is faster than the state-of-the-art, more flexible and could potentially be implemented in hardware.},
