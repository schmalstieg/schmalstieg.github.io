  abstract =   "Efficient rendering of multiple views can be a critical
               performance factor for real-time rendering applications.
               Generating more than one view multiplies the amount of
               rendered geometry, which can cause a huge performance
               impact. Minimizing that impact has been a target of previous
               research and GPU manufacturers, who have started to equip
               devices with dedicated acceleration units. However,
               vendor-specific acceleration is not the only option to
               increase multi-view rendering (MVR) performance. Available
               graphics API features, shader stages and optimizations can
               be exploited for improved MVR performance, while generally
               offering more versatile pipeline configurations, including
               the preservation of custom tessellation and geometry
               shaders. In this paper, we present an exhaustive evaluation
               of MVR pipelines available on modern GPUs. We provide a
               detailed analysis of previous techniques,
               hardware-accelerated MVR and propose a novel method, leading
               to the creation of an MVR catalogue. Our analyses cover
               three distinct applications to help gain clarity on overall
               MVR performance characteristics. Our interpretation of the
               observed results provides a guideline for selecting the most
               appropriate one for various use cases on different GPU
               architectures.",
