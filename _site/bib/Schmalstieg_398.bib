abstract={Augmented reality (AR) is a technology which extends the user’s reality by including computer-generated, virtual information within their view. As such, AR technology is a valuable asset in the medical domain, where it has the potential to grant “X-ray vision” to physicians, allowing them to view medical data in situ, in the same physical space as the patient, in the most intuitive way. Consequently, medical applications have been the focus of considerable research efforts since the early days of AR, be it in the context of medical education and training, patient rehabilitation and therapy, or in clinical applications such as computer-aided interventions. In this chapter, we will review the most important technical concepts of AR in general, discussing display technology, tracking paradigms and visualization techniques, among other things. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview over current applications, practices, and challenges of AR, specific to the medical domain. Finally, AR in oral and cranio-maxillofacial surgery will be discussed, starting with a discussion of shortcomings of current computer-assisted procedures and how AR can aid to overcome them. We then provide a historical perspective on AR in oral and maxillofacial surgery, ending with a review of the current state-of-the-art.},
