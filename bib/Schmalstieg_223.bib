 abstract={Current projectors can easily be combined to create an everywhere display, using all suitable surfaces in offices or meeting rooms for the presentation of information. However, the resulting irregular display is not well supported by tradi tional desktop window managers, which are optimized for rectangular screens. In this paper, we present novel display-adaptive window management techniques, which provide semi-automatic placement for desktop elements (such as windows or icons) for users of large, irregularly shaped displays. We report results from an exploratory study, which reveals interesting emerging strategies of users in the manipulation of windows on large irregular displays and shows that the new techniques increase subjective satisfaction with the window management interface.},
