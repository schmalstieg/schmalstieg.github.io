 abstract={In this paper we present collaborative scientific visualization in STUDIERSTUBE. STUDIERSTUBE is an augmented reality system that has several advantages over conventional desktop and other virtual reality environments, including true stereoscopy, 3D-interaction, individual viewpoints and customized views for multiple users, unhindered natural collaboration and low cost. We demonstrate the application of this concept for the interaction of multiple users and illustrate it with several visualizations of dynamical systemsin DynSys3D, a visualization system running on top of AVS.},
