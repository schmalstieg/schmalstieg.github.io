 abstract={Optical tracking systems allow three-dimensional input for virtual environment applications with high precision and without annoying cables. Spontaneous and intuitive interaction is possible through gestures. In this paper, we present a finger tracker that allows gestural interaction and is simple, cheap, fast, robust against occlusion and accurate. It is based on a marked glove, a stereoscopic tracking system and a kinematic 3-d model of the human finger. Within our augmented reality application scenario, the user is able to grab, translate, rotate, and release objects in an intuitive way. We demonstrate our tracking system in an augmented reality chess game allowing a user to interact with virtual objects.},
