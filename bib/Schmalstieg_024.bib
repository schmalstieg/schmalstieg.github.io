 abstract={The Virtual Table presents stereoscopic graphics to a user in a workbench-like setting. This paper reports on a user interface and new interaction techniques for the Virtual Table based on transparent props - a tracked hand-held pen and a pad. These props, but in particular the pad, are augmented with 3D graphics from the Virtual Table's display. This configuration creates a very powerful and flexible interface for two-handed interaction that can be applied to other back-projected stereographic displays as well: The pad can serve as a palette for tools and controls as well as a window-like see-through interface, a plane-shaped and through-the-plane tool, supporting a variety of new interaction techniques.},
