	abstract={This paper presents the first photometric registration pipeline for Mixed Reality based on high quality illumination estimation byconvolutional neural network (CNN) methods. For easy adaptation and deployment of the system, we train the CNN using purelysynthetic images and apply them to real image data. To keep thepipeline accurate and efficient, we propose to fuse the light estimation results from multiple CNN instances, and we show an approach for caching estimates over time. For optimal performance, we furthermore explore multiple strategies for the CNN training. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields highly accurate estimates for photo-realistic augmentation},
