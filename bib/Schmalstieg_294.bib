	abstract={In this work, we present a new automatic system for scene reconstruction of high-level structural models. We start with identifying planar regions in depth images obtained with a SLAM system. Our main contribution is an approach which identifies constraints such as incidence and orthogonality of planar surfaces and uses them in an incremental optimization framework to extract high-level structural models. The result is a manifold mesh with a low number of polygons, immediately useful in many Augmented Reality applications such as inspection, interior design or spatial interaction},
