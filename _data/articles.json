    "abstract": "Real-time visibility determination in expansive or dynamically changing environments has long posed a significant challenge in computer graphics. Existing techniques are computationally expensive and often applied as a precomputation step on a static scene. We present NeuralPVS, the first deep-learning approach for visibility computation that efficiently determines from-region visibility in a large scene, running at approximately 100 Hz processing with less than 1% missing geometry. This approach is possible by using a neural network operating on a froxelized representation of the scene. The network's performance is achieved by combining sparse convolution with a 3D volume-preserving interleaving for data compression. Moreover, we introduce a novel repulsive visibility loss that can effectively guide the network to converge to the correct data distribution. This loss provides enhanced robustness and generalization to unseen scenes. Our results demonstrate that NeuralPVS outperforms existing visibility methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The computation of a potentially visible set (PVS) can accelerate many computer graphics algorithms, such as framerate upsampling, streaming rendering, global illumination, and multi-fragment effects. Algorithms for from-region PVS have an inherently high complexity. Previous from-region PVS algorithms propagate occlusion through the scene in a front-to-back manner and are order-dependent, which places bounds on parallelism and restricts execution speed. We introduce the disocclusion buffer, which operates on a sparse, layered representation of the scene with quantized depth. In this representation, we invert the traditional PVS problem formulation and explicitly compute disocclusion rather than occlusion. Disocclusion can be computed in parallel in an order-independent manner, overcoming the main bottleneck in traditional PVS computation. Our PVS algorithm is over six times faster than the previous state of the art at the same level of accuracy in a direct comparison. It runs in shaders on the GPU without requiring any hardware extensions. We demonstrate how our work outperforms previous PVS algorithms in the range of supported camera motion without compromising quality.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces---particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments---remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.",

Holistic usage scenarios in mixed reality involve tasks suited alternately to 2D or 3D information spaces. Yet, existing input devices excel in either 2D or 3D, but not both, making it necessary to switch between multiple input devices (e.g., mouse and VR controller). Our SpatialMouse addresses this issue, offering the affordances of a desktop mouse for indirect 2D pointing and the spatial capabilities of VR controllers with six degrees of freedom. In a user study with 12 participants, our prototype significantly reduced perceived task load and improved user experience compared to switching between separate devices.

    "abstract": "Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.",

In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting, has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.",

    "abstract": "Large transparent touch screens (LTTS) have recently become commercially available. These displays have the potential for engaging Augmented Reality (AR) applications, especially in public and shared spaces. However, the interaction with objects in the real environment behind the display remains challenging: Users must combine pointing and touch input if they want to select objects at varying distances. There is a lot of work on wearable or mobile AR displays, but little on how users interact with LTTS. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of natural user interaction for these AR displays. To this end, we developed a prototype and evaluated different pointing techniques for selecting 12 physical targets behind an LTTS, with distances ranging from 6 to 401~cm. We conducted a user study with 16 participants and measured user preferences, performance, and behavior. We analyzed the change in accuracy depending on the target position and the selection technique used. Our findings include: (a) Users naturally align the touch point with their line of sight for targets farther than 36~cm behind the LTTS. (b) This technique provides the lowest angular deviation compared to other techniques. (c) Some user close one eye to improve their performance. Our results help to improve future AR scenarios using LTTS systems.",

Especially for immersive analytics, which often blends 3D interaction spaces with traditional 2D workflows, such hybrid user interfaces can reduce cognitive workload and improve user experience. Prior work has combined desktop-based statistical analysis with an in-situ exploration of spatiotemporal data in mixed reality. However, switching between devices and input modalities in such combinations can disrupt users' flow. We revisit the concept of hybrid input devices that operate seamlessly across 2D and 3D contexts by leveraging the complementary strengths of heterogeneous input devices. We thereby propose a hypothetical hybrid input device that combines input from a mouse and a spatial controller, for which we present potential interaction techniques and discuss potential opportunities and challenges for immersive analytics.",

    "abstract": "In mixed reality (MR) telepresence applications, the differences between participants' physical environments can interfere with effective collaboration. For asymmetric tasks, users might need to access different resources (information, objects, tools) distributed throughout their room. Existing intersection methods do not support such interactions, because a large portion of the telepresence participants' rooms become inaccessible, along with the relevant task resources. We propose MRUnion, a Mixed Reality Telepresence pipeline for asymmetric task-aware 3D mutual scene generation. The key concept of our approach is to enable a user in an asymmetric telecollaboration scenario to access the entire room, while still being able to communicate with remote users in a shared space. For this purpose, we introduce a novel mutual room layout called Union. We evaluated 882 space combinations quantitatively involving two, three, and four combined remote spaces and compared it to a conventional Intersect room layout. The results show that our method outperforms existing intersection methods and enables a significant increase in space and accessibility to resources within the shared space. In an exploratory user study (N=24), we investigated the applicability of the synthetic mutual scene in both MR and VR setups, where users collaborated on an asymmetric remote assembly task. The study results showed that our method achieved comparable results to the intersect method but requires further investigation in terms of social presence, safety and support of collaboration. From this study, we derived design implications for synthetic mutual spaces.",

    "abstract": "Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.",

    "abstract": "Shape reconstruction from imaging volumes is a recurring need in medical image analysis. Common workflows start with a segmentation step, followed by careful post-processing and, finally, ad hoc meshing algorithms. As this sequence can be time-consuming, neural networks are trained to reconstruct shapes through template deformation. These networks deliver state-of-the-art results without manual intervention, but, so far, they have primarily been evaluated on anatomical shapes with little topological variety between individuals. In contrast, other works favor learning implicit shape models, which have multiple benefits for meshing and visualization. Our work follows this direction by introducing deep medial voxels, a semi-implicit representation that faithfully approximates the topological skeleton from imaging volumes and eventually leads to shape reconstruction via convolution surfaces. Our reconstruction technique shows potential for both visualization and computer simulations.",

    "abstract": "The vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) presents a major perceptual challenge for head-mounted displays with a fixed image plane. Varifocal and layered display designs can mitigate the VAC. However, the image quality of varifocal displays is affected by imprecise eye tracking, whereas layered displays suffer from reduced image contrast as the distance between layers increases. Combined designs support a larger workspace and tolerate some eye-tracking error. However, any layered design with a fixed layer spacing restricts the amount of error compensation and limits the in-focus contrast. We extend previous hybrid designs by introducing confidence-driven volume control, which adjusts the size of the view volume at runtime. We use the eye tracker's confidence to control the spacing of display layers and optimize the trade-off between the display's view volume and the amount of eye tracking error the display can compensate. In the case of high-quality focus point estimation, our approach provides high in-focus contrast, whereas low-quality eye tracking increases the view volume to tolerate the error. We describe our design, present its implementation as an optical-see head-mounted display using a multiplicative layer combination, and present an evaluation comparing our design with previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents guitARhero, an Augmented Reality application for interactively teaching guitar playing to beginners through responsive visualizations overlaid on the guitar neck. We support two types of visual guidance, a highlighting of the frets that need to be pressed and a 3D hand overlay, as well as two display scenarios, one using a desktop magic mirror and one using a video see-through head-mounted display. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to evaluate how well users could follow instructions presented with different guidance and display combinations and compare these to a baseline where users had to follow video instructions. Our study highlights the trade-off between the provided information and visual clarity affecting the user's ability to interpret and follow instructions for fine-grained tasks. We show that the perceived usefulness of instruction integration into an HMD view highly depends on the hardware capabilities and instruction details.",

Our work extends compact world anchors with a search data structure to efficiently perform localization and pose estimation of mobile augmented reality devices across multiple platforms (e.g., HoloLens 2, iPad). The algorithm uses a bag-of-words approach to characterize distinct scenes (e.g., rooms). Since the individual scene representations rely on compact geometric (rather than appearance-based) features, the resulting search structure is very lightweight and fast, lending itself to deployment on mobile devices. We present a set of experiments demonstrating the accuracy, performance and scalability of our novel localization method. In addition, we describe several use cases demonstrating how efficient cross-platform localization facilitates sharing of augmented reality experiences.",

    "abstract": "Multi-layer images are currently the most prominent scene representation for viewing natural scenes under full-motion parallax in virtual reality. Layers ordered in diopter space contain color and transparency so that a complete image is formed when the layers are composited in a view-dependent manner. Once baked, the same limitations apply to multi-layer images as to conventional single-layer photography, making it challenging to remove obstructive objects or otherwise edit the content. Object removal before baking can benefit from filling disoccluded layers with pixels from background layers. However, if no such background pixels have been observed, an inpainting algorithm must fill the empty spots with fitting synthetic content. We present and study a multi-layer inpainting approach that addresses this problem in two stages: First, a volumetric area of interest specified by the user is classified with respect to whether the background pixels have been observed or not. Second, the unobserved pixels are filled with multi-layer inpainting. We report on experiments using multiple variants of multi-layer inpainting and compare our solution to conventional inpainting methods that consider each layer individually.",

    "abstract": "Situated visualization has become an increasingly popular research area in the visualization community, fueled by advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology and immersive analytics. Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows.",

    "abstract": "Presenting tutorials in augmented reality is a compelling application area, but previous attempts have been limited to objects with only a small numbers of parts. Scaling augmented reality tutorials to complex assemblies of a large number of parts is difficult, because it requires automatically discriminating many similar-looking object configurations, which poses a challenge for current object detection techniques. In this paper, we seek to lift this limitation. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, even though the number of assembly steps may be large, their order is typically highly restricted: Some actions can only be performed after others. To leverage this observation, we enhance a state-of-the-art object detector to predict the current assembly state by conditioning on the previous one, and to learn the constraints on consecutive states. This learned `consecutive state prior' helps the detector disambiguate configurations that are otherwise too similar in terms of visual appearance to be reliably discriminated. Via the state prior, the detector is also able to improve the estimated probabilities that a state detection is correct. We experimentally demonstrate that our technique enhances the detection accuracy for assembly sequences with a large number of steps and on a variety of use cases, including furniture, Lego and origami. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of our algorithm in an interactive augmented reality application.",

    "abstract": "Visibility computation is a key element in computer graphics applications. More specifically, a from-region potentially visible set (PVS) is an established tool in rendering acceleration, but its high computational cost means a from-region PVS is almost always precomputed. Precomputation restricts the use of PVS to static scenes and leads to high storage cost, in particular, if we need fine-grained regions. For dynamic applications, such as streaming content over a variable-bandwidth network, online PVS computation with configurable region size is required. We address this need with trim regions, a new method for generating from-region PVS for arbitrary scenes in real time. Trim regions perform controlled erosion of object silhouettes in image space, implicitly applying the shrinking theorem known from previous work. Our algorithm is the first that applies automatic shrinking to unconstrained 3D scenes, including non-manifold meshes, and does so in real time using an efficient GPU execution model. We demonstrate that our algorithm generates a tight PVS for complex scenes and outperforms previous online methods for from-viewpoint and from-region PVS. It runs at 60 Hz for realistic game scenes consisting of millions of triangles and computes PVS with a tightness matching or surpassing existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "The HoloLens (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), a head-worn, optically see-through augmented reality (AR) display, is the main player in the recent boost in medical AR research. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the usage of the first-generation HoloLens within the medical domain, from its release in March 2016, until the year of 2021. We identified 217 relevant publications through a systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and SpringerLink databases. We propose a new taxonomy including use case, technical methodology for registration and tracking, data sources, visualization as well as validation and evaluation, and analyze the retrieved publications accordingly. We find that the bulk of research focuses on supporting physicians during interventions, where the HoloLens is promising for procedures usually performed without image guidance. However, the consensus is that accuracy and reliability are still too low to replace conventional guidance systems. Medical students are the second most common target group, where AR-enhanced medical simulators emerge as a promising technology. While concerns about human-computer interactions, usability and perception are frequently mentioned, hardly any concepts to overcome these issues have been proposed. Instead, registration and tracking lie at the core of most reviewed publications, nevertheless only few of them propose innovative concepts in this direction. Finally, we find that the validation of HoloLens applications suffers from a lack of standardized and rigorous evaluation protocols. We hope that this review can advance medical AR research by identifying gaps in the current literature, to pave the way for novel, innovative directions and translation into the medical routine.",

In addition, we build two prototypes using a head-mounted display in combination with a stereoscopic direct-view display, and a more widely available monoscopic direct-view display. In addition we show how extending off-axis layered displays with an attenuation layer and with eye-tracking can improve image quality. We thoroughly analyze each component in a technical evaluation and present examples captured through our prototypes.",

    "abstract": "Commonly used image-space layouts of shading points, such as used in deferred shading, are strictly view-dependent, which restricts efficient caching and temporal amortization. In contrast, texture-space layouts can represent shading on all surface points and can be tailored to the needs of a particular application. However, the best grouping of shading points - which we call a shading unit - in texture space remains unclear. Choices of shading unit granularity (how many primitives or pixels per unit) and in shading unit parametrization (how to assign texture coordinates to shading points) lead to different outcomes in terms of final image quality, overshading cost, and memory consumption. Among the possible choices, shading units consisting of larger groups of scene primitives, so-called meshlets, remain unexplored as of yet. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy for analyzing existing texture-space shading methods based on the group size and parametrization of shading units. Furthermore, we introduce a novel texture-space layout strategy that operates on large shading units: the meshlet shading atlas. We experimentally demonstrate that the meshlet shading atlas outperforms previous approaches in terms of image quality, run-time performance and temporal upsampling for a given number of fragment shader invocations. The meshlet shading atlas lends itself to work together with popular cluster-based rendering of meshes with high geometric detail.",

The abilities of RagRug go beyond previous immersive analytics toolkits by focusing on specific requirements emerging when using augmented reality (AR) rather than virtual reality. RagRug combines state of the art visual encoding capabilities with a comprehensive physical-virtual model, which lets application developers systematically describe the physical objects in the real world and their role in AR. We connect AR visualizations with data streams from the Internet of Things using distributed dataflow. To this end, we use reactive programming patterns so that visualizations become context-aware, i.e., they adapt to events coming in from the environment. The resulting authoring system is low-code; it emphasises describing the physical and the virtual world and the dataflow between the elements contained therein. We describe the technical design and implementation of RagRug, and report on five example applications illustrating the toolkit's abilities.",

Keyframe selection has a significant impact on the inpainting quality, but untrained users struggle to identify good keyframes. Automatic selection is not straightforward either, since no previous work has formalized or verified what determines a good keyframe. We propose a novel metric to select good keyframes to inpaint. We examine the heuristics adopted in existing DR inpainting approaches and derive multiple simple criteria measurable from SLAM. To combine these criteria, we empirically analyze their effect on the quality using a novel representative test dataset. Our results demonstrate that the combined metric selects RGBD keyframes leading to high-quality inpainting results more often than a baseline approach in both color and depth domains. Also, we confirmed that our approach has a better ranking ability of distinguishing good and bad keyframes. Compared to random selections, our metric selects keyframes that would lead to higher-quality and more stably converging inpainting results. We present three DR examples, automatic keyframe selection, user navigation, and marker hiding.",

Our method solves the registration in closed-form from three line-to-line, line-to-plane or plane-to-plane correspondences. The approach either works with semantically segmented RGBD scans of the scene or with the output of plane detection in common frameworks like ARKit and ARCore. Based on the primitives detected in the scene, we build a list of descriptors using the normals and centroids of all the found primitives, and match them against the pre-computed list of descriptors from the model in order to find the scene-to-model primitive correspondences. Finally, we use our closed-form solver to estimate the 6DOF transformation from three lines and one point, which we obtain from the parametric representations of the model and scene parametric primitives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method. We show that it can be used to create compact world anchors for indoor localization in AR applications on mobile devices leveraging commercial SLAM capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Among the most compelling applications of Augmented Reality are spatially registered tutorials. The effort of creating such instructions remains one of the obstacles precluding a wider use. We propose a system that is capable of extracting 3D instructions in a completely model-free manner from demonstrations, based on volumetric changes. The instructions are visualised later in an interactive Augmented Reality guidance application, on a mobile head-mounted display. We enable a technology that can be used by anyone in an ad-hoc tabletop setup for assemblies with rigid components.",

    "abstract": "Surgical navigation requires tracking of instruments with respect to the patient. Conventionally, tracking is done with stationary cameras, and the navigation information is displayed on a stationary display. In contrast, an augmented reality (AR) headset can superimpose surgical navigation information directly in the surgeon's view. However, AR needs to track the headset, the instruments and the patient, often by relying on stationary infrastructure. We show that 6DOF tracking can be obtained without any stationary, external system by purely utilizing the on-board stereo cameras of a HoloLens 2 to track the same retro-reflective marker spheres used by current optical navigation systems. Our implementation is based on two tracking pipelines complementing each other, one using conventional stereo vision techniques, the other relying on a single-constraint-at-a-time extended Kalman filter. In a technical evaluation of our tracking approach, we show that clinically relevant accuracy of 1.70 mm/1.11 degree and real-time performance is achievable. We further describe an example application of our system for untethered end-to-end surgical navigation.",

    "abstract": "Temporal coherence has the potential to enable a huge reduction of shading costs in rendering. Existing techniques focus either only on spatial shading reuse or cannot adaptively choose temporal shading frequencies. We find that temporal shading reuse is possible for extended periods of time for a majority of samples, and we show under which circumstances users perceive temporal artifacts. Our analysis implies that we can approximate shading gradients to efficiently determine when and how long shading can be reused. While visibility usually stays temporally coherent from frame to frame for more than 90 percent, we find that, even in heavily animated game scenes with advanced shading, typically more than 50 percent of shading is temporally coherent. To exploit this potential, we introduce a temporally adaptive shading framework and apply it to two real-time methods. Its application saves more than 57 percent of the shader invocations, reducing overall rendering times up to 5 times in virtual reality applications without a noticeable loss in visual quality. Overall, our work shows that there is significantly more potential for shading reuse than currently exploited.",

As such, AR technology is a valuable asset in the medical domain, where it has the potential to grant X-ray vision to physicians, allowing them to view medical data in situ, in the same physical space as the patient, in the most intuitive way. Consequently, medical applications have been the focus of considerable research efforts since the early days of AR, be it in the context of medical education and training, patient rehabilitation and therapy, or in clinical applications such as computer-aided interventions. In this chapter, we will review the most important technical concepts of AR in general, discussing display technology, tracking paradigms and visualization techniques, among other things. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview over current applications, practices, and challenges of AR, specific to the medical domain. Finally, AR in oral and cranio-maxillofacial surgery will be discussed, starting with a discussion of shortcomings of current computer-assisted procedures and how AR can aid to overcome them. We then provide a historical perspective on AR in oral and maxillofacial surgery, ending with a review of the current state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "A fast and fully automatic design of 3D printed patient-specific cranial implants is highly desired in cranioplasty - the process to restore a defect on the skull. We formulate skull defect restoration as a 3D volumetric shape completion task, where a partial skull volume is completed automatically. The difference between the completed skull and the partial skull is the restored defect; in other words, the implant that can be used in cranioplasty. To fulfill the task of volumetric shape completion, a fully data-driven approach is proposed. Supervised skull shape learning is performed on a database containing 167 high-resolution healthy skulls. In these skulls, synthetic defects are injected to create training and evaluation data pairs. We propose a patch-based training scheme tailored for dealing with high-resolution and spatially sparse data, which overcomes the disadvantages of conventional patch-based training methods in high-resolution volumetric shape completion tasks. In particular, the conventional patch-based training is applied to images of high resolution and proves to be effective in tasks such as segmentation. However, we demonstrate the limitations of conventional patch-based training for shape completion tasks, where the overall shape distribution of the target has to be learnt, since it cannot be captured efficiently by a sub-volume cropped from the target. Additionally, the standard dense implementation of a convolutional neural network tends to perform poorly on sparse data, such as the skull, which has a low voxel occupancy rate. Our proposed training scheme encourages a convolutional neural network to learn from the high-resolution and spatially sparse data. In our study, we show that our deep learning models, trained on healthy skulls with synthetic defects, can be transferred directly to craniotomy skulls with real defects of greater irregularity, and the results show promise for clinical use.

However, these approaches produce artifacts, if the scene geometry is not sufficiently planar. In this paper, wepresent InpaintFusion, a new real-time method that extends inpainting to non-planar scenes by considering both color and depth information in the inpainting process. We use an RGB-D sensor for simultaneous localization and mapping, in order to both track the camera and obtain a surfel map in addition to RGB images. We use the RGB-D information in a cost function for both the color and the geometric appearance to derive a global optimization for simultaneous inpainting of color and depth. The inpainted depth is merged in a global map by depth fusion. For the final rendering, we project the map model into image space, where we can use it for effects such as relighting and stereo rendering of otherwise hidden structures. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by comparing it to inpainting results with methods using planar geometric proxies.",

    "abstract": "Efficient rendering of multiple views can be a critical performance factor for real-time rendering applications. Generating more than one view multiplies the amount of rendered geometry, which can cause a huge performance impact. Minimizing that impact has been a target of previous research and GPU manufacturers, who have started to equip devices with dedicated acceleration units. However, vendor-specific acceleration is not the only option to increase multi-view rendering (MVR) performance. Available graphics API features, shader stages and optimizations can be exploited for improved MVR performance, while generally offering more versatile pipeline configurations, including the preservation of custom tessellation and geometry shaders. In this paper, we present an exhaustive evaluation of MVR pipelines available on modern GPUs. We provide a detailed analysis of previous techniques, hardware-accelerated MVR and propose a novel method, leading to the creation of an MVR catalogue. Our analyses cover three distinct applications to help gain clarity on overall MVR performance characteristics. Our interpretation of the observed results provides a guideline for selecting the most appropriate one for various use cases on different GPU architectures.",

Simple reconstruction methods solely use the frames of the depth camera, leaving any imagery from the adjunct RGB camera untouched. Recent approaches also incorporate color camera information to improve consistency. However, the results heavily depend on the accuracy of the rig calibration, which can strongly vary in quality. Unfortunately, any errors in the rig calibration result in apparent visual discrepancies when it comes to colorization of the 3D reconstruction. We propose an easy approach to fix this issue for the purpose of image-based rendering. We show that a relatively simple warping function can be calculated from a 3D checkerboard pattern for a rig with poor calibration between cameras. The warping is applied to the RGB images online during reconstruction, leading to a significantly improved visual result.",

    "abstract": "Registering a known model with noisy sample measurements is in general a difficult task due to the problem in finding correspondences between the samples and points on the known model. General frameworks exist, such as variants of the classical iterative closest point (ICP) method to iteratively refine correspondence estimates. However, the methods are prone to getting trapped in locally optimal configurations, which may be far from the true registration. The quality of the final registration depends strongly on the set of samples. The quality of the set of sample measurements is more noticeable when the number of samples is relatively low (about 20). We consider sample selection in the context of active perception, i.e. an objective-driven decision-making process, to motivate our research and the construction of our system. We design a system for learning how to select the regions of the scene to sample, and, in doing so, improve the accuracy and efficiency of the sampling process. We present a full environment for learning how best to sample a scene in order to quickly and accurately register a model with the scene. This work has broad applicability from the fields of geodesy to medical robotics, where the cost of taking a measurement is much higher than the cost of incremental changes to the pose of the equipment.",

A remote expert can access the digital interfaces and provide the worker with timely information and advice in an augmented reality display. The remote expert has full control over the user interface of the worker in a manner comparable to remote desktop systems. The worker needs to perform all physical operations and retrieve physical information, such as reading physical labels or meters. Thus, worker and remote expert collaborate not only via shared audio, video or pointing, but also share control of the digital interface presented in the augmented reality space. We report results on two studies: The first study evaluates the benefits of our system against a condition with the same cyber-physical interface, but without tele-assistance. Results indicate significant benefits concerning speed, cognitive load and subjective comfort of the worker. The second study explores how interface designers use our system, leading to initial design guidelines for tele-presence interfaces like ours.",

    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for generating an unstructured lumigraph in real-time from an image stream. This problem has important applications in mixed reality, such as telepresence, interior design or as-built documentation. Unlike conventional texture optimization in structure from motion, our method must choose views from the input stream in a strictly incremental manner, since only a small number of views can be stored or transmitted. This requires formulating an online variant of the well-known view-planning problem, which must take into account what parts of the scene have already been seen and how the lumigraph sample distribution could improve in the future. We address this highly unconstrained problem by regularizing the scene structure using a regular grid structure. Upon the grid structure, we define a coverage metric describing how well the lumigraph samples cover the grid in terms of spatial and angular resolution, and we greedily keep incoming views if they improve the coverage. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively on a variety of synthetic and real scenes, and demonstrate visually appealing results obtained at real-time frame rates (in the range of 3Hz-100Hz per incoming image, depending on configuration).",

We present a system allowing a physician wearing an untethered augmented reality headset to see medical visualizations precisely overlaid onto the patient. Our main contribution is a strategy for markerless registration of 3D imaging to the patient's face. We use a neural network to detect the face using the headset's depth sensor and register it to computed tomography data. The face registration is seamlessly combined with the headset's continuous self-localization. We report on registration error and compare our approach to an external, high-precision infrared tracking system.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to indoor tracking using computer vision, which has reached a good amount of maturity, outdoor tracking still suffers from comparably poor localization on a global scale. Smartphones and other commodity devices contain consumer-grade sensors for GPS, compass and inertial measurements, which are not accurate enough for augmented reality (AR) in most situations. This restricts what AR can offer to application areas such as surveying or building constructions. We present a self-contained localization device which connects wirelessly to any AR device, such as a smartphone or headset. The device gives centimeter-level accuracy and can be built out of commercial-of-the-shelf components for less than 500 EUR. We demonstrate the performance of the localization device using a variety of position and orientation sensing benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Exploration of challenging indoor environments is a demanding task. While automation with aerial robots seems a promising solution, fully autonomous systems still struggle with high-level cognitive tasks and intuitive decision making. To facilitate automation, we introduce a novel teleoperation system with an aerial telerobot that is capable of handling all demanding low-level tasks. Motivated by the typical structure of indoor environments, the system creates an interactive scene topology in real-time that reduces scene details and supports affordances. Thus, difficult high-level tasks can be effectively supervised by a human operator. To elaborate on the effectiveness of our system during a real-world exploration mission, we conducted a user study. Despite being limited by real-world constraints, results indicate that our system better supports operators with indoor exploration, compared to a baseline system with traditional joystick control.",

We show a parallel implementation of our rasterizer, which naturally supports all kinds of color spaces, blending and super-sampling.

    "abstract": "Having a virtual body can increase embodiment in virtual reality (VR) applications. However, comsumer-grade VR falls short of delivering sufficient sensory information for full-body motion capture. Consequently, most current VR applications do not even show arms, although they are often in the field of view. We address this shortcoming with a novel human upper-body inverse kinematics algorithm specifically targeted at tracking from head and hand sensors only. We present heuristics for elbow positioning depending on the shoulder-to-hand distance and for avoiding reaching unnatural joint limits. Our results show that our method increases the accuracy compared to general inverse kinematics applied to human arms with the same tracking input. In a user study, participants preferred our method over displaying disembodied hands without arms, but also over a more expensive motion capture system. In particular, our study shows that virtual arms animated with our inverse kinematics system can be used for applications involving heavy arm movement. We demonstrate that our method can not only be used to increase embodiment, but can also support interaction involving arms or shoulders, such as holding up a shield.",

We introduce Shading Atlas Streaming (SAS), a novel object-space rendering framework suitable for streaming virtual reality content. SAS decouples server-side shading from client-side rendering, allowing the client to perform framerate upsampling and latency compensation autonomously for short periods of time. The shading information created by the server in object space is temporally coherent and can be efficiently compressed using standard MPEG encoding. Our results show that SAS compares favorably to previous methods for remote image-based rendering in terms of image quality and network bandwidth efficiency. SAS allows highly efficient parallel allocation in a virtualized-texture-like memory hierarchy, solving a common efficiency problem of object-space shading. With SAS, untethered virtual reality headsets can benefit from high quality rendering without paying in increased latency.",

As opposed to previous work, our approach features a fully-concurrent, multi-stage, streaming design with dynamic load balancing, capable of operating efficiently within bounded memory. We address issues such as primitive order, vertex reuse, and screen-space derivatives of dependent variables, which are essential to real-world applications, but have largely been ignored by comparable work in the past. The power of a software approach lies in the ability to tailor the graphics pipeline to any given application. In exploration of this potential, we design and implement four novel pipeline modifications. Evaluation of the performance of our approach on more than 100 real-world scenes collected from video games shows rendering speeds within one order of magnitude of the hardware graphics pipeline as well as significant improvements over previous work, not only in terms of capabilities and performance, but also robustness.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) crime scene documentation using 3D scanners and medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly applied in forensic casework. Together with digital photography, these modalities enable comprehensive and non-invasive recording of forensically relevant information regarding injuries/pathologies inside the body and on its surface. Furthermore, it is possible to capture traces and items at crime scenes. Such digitally secured evidence has the potential to similarly increase case understanding by forensic experts and non-experts in court. Unlike photographs and 3D surface models, images from CT and MRI are not self-explanatory. Their interpretation and understanding requires radiological knowledge. Findings in tomography data must not only be revealed, but should also be jointly studied with all the 2D and 3D data available in order to clarify spatial interrelations and to optimally exploit the data at hand. This is technically challenging due to the heterogeneous data representations including volumetric data, polygonal 3D models, and images. This paper presents a novel computer-aided forensic toolbox providing tools to support the analysis, documentation, annotation, and illustration of forensic cases using heterogeneous digital data. Conjoint visualization of data from different modalities in their native form and efficient tools to visually extract and emphasize findings help experts to reveal unrecognized correlations and thereby enhance their case understanding. Moreover, the 3D case illustrations created for case analysis represent an efficient means to convey the insights gained from case analysis to forensic non-experts involved in court proceedings like jurists and laymen. The capability of the presented approach in the context of case analysis, its potential to speed up legal procedures and to ultimately enhance legal certainty is demonstrated by introducing a number of representative forensic cases.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the power of massively parallel devices like the graphics processing unit (GPU) is difficult for algorithms that show dynamic or inhomogeneous workloads. To achieve high performance, such advanced algorithms require scalable, concurrent queues to collect and distribute work. We show that previous queuing approaches are unfit for this task, as they either (1) do not work well in a massively parallel environment, or (2) obstruct the use of individual threads on top of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) cores, or (3) block during access, thus prohibiting multi-queue setups. With these issues in mind, we present the Broker Queue, a highly efficient, fully linearizable FIFO queue for fine-granular parallel work distribution on the GPU. We evaluate its performance and usability on modern GPU models against a wide range of existing algorithms. The Broker Queue is up to three orders of magnitude faster than non-blocking queues and can even outperform significantly simpler techniques that lack desired properties for fine-granular work distribution.",

    "abstract": "Drones allow exploring dangerous or impassable areas safely from a distant point of view. However, flight control froman egocentric view in narrow or constrained environments can be challenging. Arguably, an exocentric view would afford a betteroverview and, thus, more intuitive flight control of the drone. Unfortunately, such an exocentric view is unavailable when exploringindoor environments. This paper investigates the potential of drone-augmented human vision, i.e., of exploring the environment andcontrolling the drone indirectly from an exocentric viewpoint. If used with a see-through display, this approach can simulate X-rayvision to provide a natural view into an otherwise occluded environment. The user's view is synthesized from a three-dimensionalreconstruction of the indoor environment using image-based rendering. This user interface is designed to reduce the cognitive load ofthe drone's flight control. The user can concentrate on the exploration of the inaccessible space, while flight control is largely delegatedto the drone's autopilot system. We assess our system with a first experiment showing how drone-augmented human vision supportsspatial understanding and improves natural interaction with the drone.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first photometric registration pipeline for Mixed Reality based on high quality illumination estimation byconvolutional neural network (CNN) methods. For easy adaptation and deployment of the system, we train the CNN using purelysynthetic images and apply them to real image data. To keep thepipeline accurate and efficient, we propose to fuse the light estimation results from multiple CNN instances, and we show an approach for caching estimates over time. For optimal performance, we furthermore explore multiple strategies for the CNN training. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields highly accurate estimates for photo-realistic augmentation",

    "abstract": "A video tutorial effectively conveys complex motions, butmay be hard to follow precisely because of its restriction toa predetermined viewpoint. Augmented reality (AR) tutori-als have been demonstrated to be more effective. We bringthe advantages of both together by interactively retargetingconventional, two-dimensional videos into three-dimensionalAR tutorials. Unlike previous work, we do not simply overlayvideo, but synthesize 3D-registered motion from the video.Since the information in the resulting AR tutorial is registeredto 3D objects, the user can freely change the viewpoint with-out degrading the experience. This approach applies to manystyles of video tutorials. In this work, we concentrate on aclass of tutorials which alter the surface of an object.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the concept of operator graph scheduling for high performance procedural generation on the graphics processing unit (GPU). The operator graph forms an intermediate representation that describes all possible operations and objects that can arise during a specific procedural generation. While previous methods have focused on parallelizing a specific procedural approach, the operator graph is applicable to all procedural generation methods that can be described by a graph, such as L-systems, shape grammars, or stack based generation methods. Using the operator graph, we show that all partitions of the graph correspond to possible ways of scheduling a procedural generation on the GPU, including the scheduling strategies of previous work. As the space of possible partitions is very large, we describe three search heuristics, aiding an optimizer in finding the fastest valid schedule for any given operator graph. The best partitions found by our optimizer increase performance of 8 to 30x over the previous state of the art in GPU shape grammar and L-system generation.",

We present a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the projection stabilization intwo autonomous flight experiments.

    "abstract": "We present a method for recovering both incident lighting and surface materials from casually scanned geometry. By casual, we mean a rapid and potentially noisy scanning procedure of unmodified and uninstrumented scenes with a commodity RGB-D sensor. In other words, unlike reconstruction procedures which require careful preparations in a laboratory environment, our method works with input that can be obtained by consumer users. To ensure a robust procedure, we segment the reconstructed geometry into surfaces with homogeneous material properties and compute the radiance transfer on these segments. With this input, we solve the inverse rendering problem of factorization into lighting and material properties using an iterative optimization in spherical harmonics form. This allows us to account for self-shadowing and recover specular properties. The resulting data can be used to generate a wide range of mixed reality applications, including the rendering of synthetic objects with matching lighting into a given scene, but also re-rendering the scene (or a part of it) with new lighting. We show the robustness of our approach with real and synthetic examples under a variety of lighting conditions and compare them with ground truth data.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of paths in graphs is highly relevant in many domains. Typically, path-related tasks are performed in node-link layouts. Unfortunately, graph layouts often do not scale to the size of many real world networks. Also, many networks are multivariate, i.e., contain rich attribute sets associated with the nodes and edges. These attributes are often critical in judging paths, but directly visualizing attributes in a graph layout exacerbates the scalability problem. In this paper, we present visual analysis solutions dedicated to path-related tasks in large and highly multivariate graphs. We show that by focusing on paths, we can address the scalability problem of multivariate graph visualization, equipping analysts with a powerful tool to explore large graphs. We introduce Pathfinder, a technique that provides visual methods to query paths, while considering various constraints. The resulting set of paths is visualized in both a ranked list and as a node-link diagram. For the paths in the list, we display rich attribute data associated with nodes and edges, and the node-link diagram provides topological context. The paths can be ranked based on topological properties, such as path length or average node degree, and scores derived from attribute data. Pathfinder is designed to scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes and edges by employing strategies such as incremental query results. We demonstrate Pathfinder's fitness for use in scenarios with data from a coauthor network and biological pathways.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) browsers show geo-referenced data in the current view of a user. When the amount of data grows too large, the display quickly becomes cluttered. Clustering items by spatial and semantic attributes can temporarily alleviate the issue, butis not effective against an increasing amount of data. We present an adaptive information density display for AR that balances the amount of presented information against the potential clutter created by placing items on the screen. We use hierarchical clustering to create a level-of-detail structure, in which nodes closer to the root encompass groups of items, while the leaf nodes contain single items. Our method selects items and groups from different levels of this hierarchy based on user-defined preferences and on the amount of visual clutter caused by placing these items. The number of presented items is adapted during user interaction to avoid clutter. We compare our interface to a conventional AR browser interface in a qualitative user study. Users clearly preferred our interface, because it provided a better overview of the data and allowed for easier comparison. In a second study, we evaluated the effect of different degrees of clustering on search and recall tasks. Users generally made fewer errors, when using our interface for a search task, which indicates that the reduced clutter allowed them to stay focused on finding the relevant item",

    "abstract": "Paper documents such as passports, visas and banknotes are frequently checked by inspection of security elements. Inparticular, optically variable devices such as holograms are important, but difficult to inspect. Augmented Reality can provide all relevant information on standard mobile devices. However, hologram verification on mobiles still takes long and provides lower accuracy than inspection by human individuals using appropriate reference information. We aim to address these drawbacks by automatic matching combined with a special parametrization of an efficient goal-oriented user interface which supports constrained navigation. We first evaluate a series of similarity measures for matching hologram patches to provide a sound basis for automatic decisions. Then a re-parametrized user interface is proposed based on observations of typical user behavior during document capture. These measures help to reduce capture time to approximately 15 s with better decisions regarding the evaluated samples than what can be achieved by untrained users.",

In this paper, we empirically evaluate four different techniques for annotation. Based on these findings, we follow up with subjective evaluations in a second experiment. Results show that presenting annotations in object space or image space leads to a significant difference in task performance. Furthermore, there is a significant interaction between rendering space and update frequency of annotations. Participants improve significantly in locating annotations, when annotations are presented in object space, and view management update rate is limited. In a follow-up experiment, participants appear to be more satisfied with limited update rate in comparison to a continuous update rate of the view management system.",

    "abstract": "While the modern graphics processing unit (GPU) offers massive parallel compute power, the ability to influence the schedulingof these immense resources is severely limited. Therefore, the GPU is widely considered to be only suitable as an externallycontrolled co-processor for homogeneous workloads which greatly restricts the potential applications of GPU computing.To address this issue, we present a new method to achieve fine-grained priority scheduling on the GPU: hierarchical bucketqueuing. By carefully distributing the workload among multiple queues and efficiently deciding which queue to draw work fromnext, we enable a variety of scheduling strategies. These strategies include fair-scheduling, earliest-deadline-first scheduling,and user-defined dynamic priority scheduling. In a comparison with a sorting-based approach, we reveal the advantages ofhierarchical bucket queuing over previous work. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of using priority scheduling in real-worldapplications by example of path tracing and foveated micropolygon rendering.",

Given a single image frame and a coarse sensor pose prior, our localization method estimatesthe absolute camera orientation from straight line segments and the translation by aligning the city map model with a semantic segmentation of the image. We use the resulting 6DOF pose, together with information inferred from the city map model, to reliably initialize and extend a 3D SLAM map in a global coordinate system, applying a model-supported SLAM mapping approach. We show the robustness and accuracy of our localization approach on a challenging dataset, and demonstrate unconstrained global SLAM mapping and tracking of arbitrary camera motion on several sequence",

    "abstract": "Conventional pipelines for capturing, displaying, and storing images are usually defined as a series of cascaded modules, each responsible for addressing a particular problem. While this divide-and-conquer approach offers many benefits, it also introduces a cumulative error, as each step in the pipeline only considers the output of the previous step, not the original sensor data. We propose an end-to-end system that is aware of the camera and image model, enforces natural-image priors, while jointly accounting for common image processing steps like demosaicking, denoising, deconvolution, and so forth, all directly in a given output representation (e.g., YUV, DCT). Our system is flexible and we demonstrate it on regular Bayer images as well as images from custom sensors. In all cases, we achieve large improvements in image quality and signal reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show that our approach is capable of very efficiently handling high-resolution images, making even mobile implementations feasible.",

    "abstract": "Large scale data analysis is nowadays a crucial part of drug discovery. Biologists and chemists need to quickly explore and evaluate potentially effective yet safe compounds based on many datasets that are in relationship with each other. However, there is a is a lack of tools that support them in these processes. To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and molecular profiling of tumors from large cohorts has enabled characterization of new tumor subtypes. This is a prerequisite for improving personalized treatment and ultimately achieving better patient outcomes. Potential tumor subtypes can be identified with methods such as unsupervised clustering or network-based stratification, which assign patients to sets based on high-dimensional molecular profiles. Detailed characterization of identified sets and their interpretation, however, remain a time-consuming exploratory process. To address these challenges, we combined 'StratomeX', an interactive visualization tool that is freely available at http://www.caleydo.org/, with exploration tools to efficiently compare multiple patient stratifications, to correlate patient sets with clinical information or genomic alterations and to view the differences between molecular profiles across patient sets. Although we focus on cancer genomics here, StratomeX can also be applied in other disease cohorts.",

We use three procedures that run concurrently on a single GPU. The first is the main rendering procedure. The second procedure computes new cache entries, and the third one corrects the errors that may arise after creation of new cache entries. We propose two distinct approaches to allow massive parallelism of cache entry creation. In addition, we show a novel extrapolation approach which outputs high quality irradiance approximations and a suitable prioritization scheme to increase the convergence rate by dedicating more computational power to more complex rendering areas.",

    "abstract": "Content on computer screens is often inaccessible to users because it is hidden, e.g., occluded by other windows, outside the viewport, or overlooked. In search tasks, the efficient retrieval of sought content is important. Current software, however, only provides limited support to visualize hidden occurrences and rarely supports search synchronization crossing application boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce two novel visualization methods to guide users to hidden content. Our first method generates awareness for occluded or out-of-viewport content using see-through visualization. For content that is either outside the screen's viewport or for data sources not opened at all, our second method shows off-screen indicators and an on-demand smart preview. To reduce the chances of overlooking content, we use visual links, i.e., visible edges, to connect the visible content or the visible representations of the hidden content. We show the validity of our methods in a user study, which demonstrates that our technique enables a faster localization of hidden content compared to traditional search functionality and thereby assists users in information retrieval tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for the parallel evaluation of procedural shape grammars on the graphics processing unit GPU. Unlike previous approaches that are either limited in the kind of shapes they allow, the amount of parallelism they can take advantage of, or both, our method supports state of the art procedural modeling including stochasticity and context-sensitivity. To increase parallelism, we explicitly express independence in the grammar, reduce inter-rule dependencies required for context-sensitive evaluation, and introduce intra-rule parallelism. Our rule scheduling scheme avoids unnecessary back and forth between CPU and GPU and reduces round trips to slow global memory by dynamically grouping rules in on-chip shared memory. Our GPU shape grammar implementation is multiple orders of magnitude faster than the standard in CPU-based rule evaluation, while offering equal expressive power. In comparison to the state of the art in GPU shape grammar derivation, our approach is nearly 50 times faster, while adding support for geometric context-sensitivity.  ",

Traditional approaches rely on evaluating a shape grammar and storing the geometry produced as a preprocessing step. During rendering, the pregenerated data is then streamed to the GPU. By interweaving generation and rendering, we overcome the problems and limitations of streaming pregenerated data. Using our methods of visibility pruning and adaptive level of detail, we are able to dynamically generate only the geometry needed to render the current view in real-time directly on the GPU. We also present a robust and efficient way to dynamically update a scene's derivation tree and geometry, enabling us to exploit frame-to-frame coherence. Our combined generation and rendering is significantly faster than all previous work. For detailed scenes, we are capable of generating geometry more rapidly than even just copying pregenerated data from main memory, enabling us to render cities with thousands of buildings at up to 100 frames per second, even with the camera moving at supersonic speed.",

However, visualization of 3D spatially-fixed multivariate volumetric data is a very challenging task. In this paper we present a method that allows simultaneous real-time visualization of multivariate data. We redistribute the opacity within a voxel to improve the readability of the color defined by a regular transfer function, and to maintain the see-through capabilities of volume rendering. We use predictable procedural noise--random-phase Gabor noise--to generate a high-frequency redistribution pattern and construct an opacity mapping function, which allows to partition the available space among the displayed data attributes. This mapping function is appropriately filtered to avoid aliasing, while maintaining transparent regions. We show the usefulness of our approach on various data sets and with different example applications. Furthermore, we evaluate our method by comparing it to other visualization techniques in a controlled user study. Overall, the results of our study indicate that users are much more accurate in determining exact data values with our novel 3D volume visualization method. Significantly lower error rates for reading data values and high subjective ranking of our method imply that it has a high chance of being adopted for the purpose of visualization of multivariate 3D data.",

    "abstract": "Biological pathway maps are highly relevant tools for many tasks in molecular biology. They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.",

A body of previous work has explored which features are suitable to support the structural interplay between occluding and occluded elements. However, the dynamics of AR environments pose serious challenges to the presentation of ghosted views. While a model of the real world may help determine distinctive structural features, changes in appearance or illumination detriment the composition of occluding and occluded structure. In this paper, we present an approach that considers the information value of the scene before and after generating the ghosted view. Hereby, a contrast adjustment of preserved occluding features is calculated, which adaptively varies their visual saliency within the ghosted view visualization. This allows us to not only preserve important features, but to also support their prominence after revealing occluded structure, thus achieving a positive effect on the perception of ghosted views.",

    "abstract": "Real-time three-dimensional acquisition of real-world scenes has many important applications in computer graphics, computer vision and human-computer interaction. Inexpensive depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect allow to leverage the development of such applications. However, this technology is still relatively recent, and no detailed studies on its scalability to dense and view-independent acquisition have been reported. This paper addresses the question of what can be done with a larger number of Kinects used simultaneously. We describe an interference-reducing physical setup, a calibration procedure and an extension to the KinectFusion algorithm, which allows to produce high quality volumetric reconstructions from multiple Kinects whilst overcoming systematic errors in the depth measurements. We also report on enhancing image based visual hull rendering by depth measurements, and compare the results to KinectFusion. Our system provides practical insight into achievable spatial and radial range and into bandwidth requirements for depth data acquisition. Finally, we present a number of practical applications of our system.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present Softshell, a novel execution model for devices composed of multiple processing cores operating in a single instruction, multiple data fashion, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). The Softshell model is intuitive and more flexible than the kernel-based adaption of the stream processing model, which is currently the dominant model for general purpose GPU computation. Using the Softshell model, algorithms with a relatively low local degree of parallelism can execute efficiently on massively parallel architectures. Softshell has the following distinct advantages: (1) work can be dynamically issued directly on the device, eliminating the need for synchronization with an external source, i.e., the CPU; (2) its three-tier dynamic scheduler supports arbitrary scheduling strategies, including dynamic priorities and real-time scheduling; and (3) the user can influence, pause, and cancel work already submitted for parallel execution. The Softshell processing model thus brings capabilities to GPU architectures that were previously only known from operating-system designs and reserved for CPU programming. As a proof of our claims, we present a publicly available implementation of the Softshell processing model realized on top of CUDA. The benchmarks of this implementation demonstrate that our processing model is easy to use and also performs substantially better than the state-of-the-art kernel-based processing model for problems that have been difficult to parallelize in the past.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new method to control scene sampling in complex ray-based rendering environments. It proposes to constrain image sampling density with a combination of object features, which are known to be well perceived by the human visual system, and image space saliency, which captures effects that are not based on the object's geometry. The presented method uses Non- Photorealistic Rendering techniques for the object space feature evaluation and combines the image space saliency calculations with image warping to infer quality hints from previously generated frames. In order to map different feature types to sampling densities, we also present an evaluation of the object space and image space features' impact on the resulting image quality. In addition, we present an efficient, adaptively aligned fractal pattern that is used to reconstruct the image from sparse sampling data. Furthermore, this paper presents an algorithm which uses our method in order to guarantee a desired minimal frame rate. Our scheduling algorithm maximizes the utilization of each given time slice by rendering features in the order of visual importance values until a time constraint is reached. We demonstrate how our method can be used to boost or stabilize the rendering time in complex ray- based image generation consisting of geometric as well as volumetric data.",

    "abstract": "Biological pathway maps are highly relevant tools for many tasks in molecular biology. They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.",

    "abstract": "As heterogeneous data from different sources are being increasingly linked, it becomes difficult for users to understand how the data are connected, to identify what means are suitable to analyze a given data set, or to find out how to proceed for a given analysis task. We target this challenge with a new model-driven design process that effectively codesigns aspects of data, view, analytics, and tasks. We achieve this by using the workflow of the analysis task as a trajectory through data, interactive views, and analytical processes. The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool. As an example for how to apply the comprehensive design approach, we present Stack'n'flip, a sample implementation which tightly integrates visualizations of the actual data with a map of available data sets, views, and tasks, thus capturing and communicating the analytical workflow through the required data sets.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous visualization of multiple continuous data attributes in a single visualization is a task that is important for many application areas. Unsurprisingly, many methods have been proposed to solve this task. However, the behavior of such methods during the exploration stage, when the user tries to understand the data with panning and zooming, has not been given much attention. In this paper, we propose a method that uses procedural texture synthesis to create zoom-independent visualizations of three scalar data attributes. The method is based on random-phase Gabor noise, whose frequency is adapted for the visualization of the first data attribute. We ensure that the resulting texture frequency lies in the range that is perceived well by the human visual system at any zoom level. To enhance the perception of this attribute, we also apply a specially constructed transfer function that is based on statistical properties of the noise. Additionally, the transfer function is constructed in a way that it does not introduce any aliasing to the texture. We map the second attribute to the texture orientation. The third attribute is color coded and combined with the texture by modifying the value component of the HSV color model. The necessary contrast needed for texture and color perception was determined in a user study. In addition, we conducted a second user study that shows significant advantages of our method over current methods with similar goals. We believe that our method is an important step towards creating methods that not only succeed in visualizing multiple data attributes, but also adapt to the behavior of the user during the data exploration stage.",

    "abstract": "Identification and characterization of cancer subtypes are important areas of research that are based on the integrated analysis of multiple heterogeneous genomics datasets. Since there are no tools supporting this process, much of this work is done using ad-hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefficient and limits visual exploration of the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill-down features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the configuration of viewing parameters in such a multi-dataset, multi-view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and configuration interface for dataset dependencies and data-view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain experts. We describe case studies that illustrate how investigators used the tool to explore subtypes in large datasets and demonstrate how they efficiently replicated findings from the literature and gained new insights into the data.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the special requirements of a dynamic memory allocator that is designed for massively parallel architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We show that traditional strategies, which work well on CPUs, are not well suited for the use on GPUs and present the thorough design of ScatterAlloc, which can efficiently deal with hundreds of requests in parallel. Our allocator greatly reduces collisions and congestion by scattering memory requests based on hashing. We analyze ScatterAlloc in terms of allocation speed, data access time and fragmentation, and compare it to current state-of-the-art allocators, including the one provided with the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. Our results show, that ScatterAlloc clearly outperforms these other approaches, yielding speed-ups between 10 to 100.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a dynamic window management technique that changes the perception of windows as fixed-sized rectangles. The primary goal of self-organizing windows is to automatically display the most relevant information for a user's current activity, which removes the burden of organizing and arranging windows from the user. We analyze the image-based representation of each window and identify coherent pieces of information. The windows are then automatically moved, scaled and composed in a contentaware manner to fit the most relevant information into the limited area of the screen. During the design process, we consider findings from previous experiments and show how users can benefit from our system. We also describe how the immense processing power of current graphics processing units can be exploited to build an interactive system that finds an optimal solution within the complex design space of all possible window transformations in real time.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating, comparing, and interpreting related pieces of information are tasks that are commonly performed during visual data analysis and in many kinds of information-intensive work. Synchronized visual highlighting of related elements is a well-known technique used to assist this task. An alternative approach, which is more invasive but also more expressive is visual linking in which line connections are rendered between related elements. In this work, we present context-preserving visual links as a new method for generating visual links. The method specifically aims to fulfill the following two goals: first, visual links should minimize the occlusion of important information; second, links should visually stand out from surrounding information by minimizing visual interference. We employ an image-based analysis of visual saliency to determine the important regions in the original representation. A consequence of the image-based approach is that our technique is application-independent and can be employed in a large number of visual data analysis scenarios in which the underlying content cannot or should not be altered. We conducted a controlled experiment that indicates that users can find linked elements in complex visualizations more quickly and with greater subjective satisfaction than in complex visualizations in which plain highlighting is used. Context-preserving visual links were perceived as visually more attractive than traditional visual links that do not account for the context information.",

Based on this information, importance-driven compositing optimizes the spatial window layout for maximum visibility and interactivity of occluded content in combination with see-through windows. We employ this technique for emerging window manager functions to minimize information overlap caused by popping up windows or floating toolbars and to improve the access to occluded window content. An initial user study indicates that our technique provides a more effective and satisfactory access to occluded information than the well-adopted Alt+Tab window switching technique and see-through windows without optimized spatial layout.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes Studierstube, an augmented reality system developed over the past four years at Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in extensive collaboration with Fraunhofer CRCG, Inc. in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. Our starting point for developing the Studierstube system was the belief that augmented reality, the less obtrusive cousin of virtual reality, has a better chance of becoming a viable user interface for applications requiring manipulation of complex three-dimensional information as a daily routine. In essence, we are searching for a 3D user interface metaphor as powerful as the desktop metaphor for 2D. At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment. In the first part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality, and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches - augmented reality, projection displays, ubiquitous computing - to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed pen-and-pad interface, which has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multi-tasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture resembles in some ways what could be called an augmented reality operating system. The presentation is complemented by selected application examples.",

    "abstract": "This article describes OpenTracker, an open software architecture that provides a framework for the different tasks involved in tracking input devices and processing multi-modal input data in virtual environments and augmented reality application. The OpenTracker framework eases the development and maintenance of hardware setups in a more flexible manner than what is typically offered by virtual reality development packages. This goal is achieved by using an object-oriented design based on XML, taking full advantage of this new technology by allowing to use standard XML tools for development, configuration and documentation. The OpenTracker engine is based on a data flow concept for multi-modal events. A multi-threaded execution model takes care of tunable performance. Transparent network access allows easy development of decoupled simulation models. Finally, the application developer's interface features both a time-based and an event based model, that can be used simultaneously, to serve a large range of applications. OpenTracker is a first attempt towards a write once, input anywhere approach to virtual reality application development. To support these claims, integration into an existing augmented reality system is demonstrated. We also show how a prototype tracking equipment for mobile augmented reality can be assembled from consumer input devices with the aid of OpenTracker. Once development is sufficiently mature, it is planned to make OpenTracker available to the public under an open source software license.",

    "abstract": "The problem of resource bottlenecks is encountered in almost any distributed virtual environment or networked game. In a typical client-server setup, where the virtual world is managed by a server and replicated by connected clients which visualize the scene, the server must repeatedly transmit update messages to the clients. The computational power needed to select the messages to transmit to each client, or the network bandwidth limitations often allow only a subset of the update messages to be transmitted to the clients; this leads to a performance degradation and an accumulation of errors, e.g., a visual error based on the positional displacement of moving objects. This paper presents a scheduling algorithm that enforces priorities based on a freely definable error metric, trying to minimize the overall error. It is able to achieve a graceful degradation of the system's performance and to minimize the risc of starvation, while retaining an output sensitive behavior. This makes it suitable not only to schedule the update messages to transmit to the various clients, but it also allows to employ filtering techniques at a constant effort.",

This concept is extended to bridge multiple user interface dimensions by including multiple users, multiple host platforms, multiple display types, multiple concurrent applications, and a multi-context (i. e., 3D document) interface into a heterogeneous distributed environment. With this architecture, we can explore the user interface design space between pure augmented reality and the popular ubiquitous computing paradigm. We report on our design philosophy centered around the notion of contexts and locales, as well as the underlying software and hardware architecture. Contexts encapsulate a live application together with 3D (visual) and other data, while locales are used to organize geometric reference systems. By separating geometric relationships (locales) from semantic relationships (contexts), we achieve a great amount of flexibility in the configuration of displays. To illustrate our claims, we present several applications including a cinematographic design tool which showcases many features of our system.",

The proposed system introduces a convenient mechanism for writing distributed graphical applications based on a popular tool in an almost transparent manner. Local variations in the scene graph allow for a wide range of possible applications, and local low latency interaction mechanisms called input streams together with a sophisticated networking architecture enable high performance while saving the programmer from network peculiarities.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new algorithm that employs image-based rendering for fast occlusion culling in complex urban environments. It exploits graphics hardware to render and automatically combine a relatively large set of occluders. The algorithm is fast to calculate and therefore also useful for scenes of moderate complexity and walkthroughs with over 20 frames per second. Occlusion is calculated dynamically and does not rely on any visibility precalculation or occluder preselection. Speed-ups of one order of magnitude can be obtained.",

This paper reports on a user interface and new interaction techniques for the Virtual Table based on transparent props - a tracked hand-held pen and a pad. These props, but in particular the pad, are augmented with 3D graphics from the Virtual Table's display. This configuration creates a very powerful and flexible interface for two-handed interaction that can be applied to other back-projected stereographic displays as well: The pad can serve as a palette for tools and controls as well as a window-like see-through interface, a plane-shaped and through-the-plane tool, supporting a variety of new interaction techniques.",

Users see the same spatially aligned model, but can independently control their viewpoint and different layers of the data to be displayed.
